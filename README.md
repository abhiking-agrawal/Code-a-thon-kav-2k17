# KAV

  KAV (Kind Adroit Versatile) is an efficient application for students that play as a crosswalk from campus life to the corporate world.
One will begin as a student and end up as a working professional upon working with us. This application covers stuff like the soft skills, corporate etiquette, and technical skills that a student needs to be aware of while entering into the corporate world. Our vision is to basically bridge the gap between student's abilities and the employer's expectations.

## Current Scope
  It currently focuses on the briefing of skills that are essential for a student to have to be successful in the corporate world. Student can visit the Learning Path page that has different modules to learn like soft skills,corporate etiquette, and technical skils. Student can contact us by filling the form available in 'Contact Us' tab. The user will get an auto-response email thanking for approaching us. 

## Future Scope
  Our future scope is to introduce a learning platform for students that includes online videos, virtual seminars, e-text books. We would introduce the elementary level quizes in order to know the ability of a student and guide accordingly. Provide certificates upon the completion of courses. Introducing different sectors other than IT. A job portal scope to create connectivity between students and the employers through us.
