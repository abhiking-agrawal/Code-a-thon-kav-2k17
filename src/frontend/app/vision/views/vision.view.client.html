                        <p>
                            Our goal is to concrete the gap between what you are and what you want to be; to help you discover a side of yourself that
                            you knew you had, but were unable to bring out.
                        </p>

                        <p>Try to bridge the gap between campus and corporate by teaching students email and telephone etiquette,
                            presentation skills, dressing and grooming, as well as preparing them for interviews by conducting
                            workshops on group discussions, personal interviews and resume writing.
